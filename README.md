# Cell_Cycle_Theory

**For users without Mathematica licence **

download the free mathematica player from:
https://www.wolfram.com/player/

Using the player you will be able to use the file with cdf extension

An example of the GUI interface is available in the file model_screenshot.png
User will be able to change the parameter available, after each alterration the "U" in the top right corner needs to be clicked to update the simulation

The cdf file will run a single iteration and output a figure similar to Figure 2 in the manuscript

CCD-2021-03-elife.nb is the file used to run simulations for different parameters and call up the model
The main function is call oneFullCycleV01 found in the cellCycleHypothesis.wl package file
